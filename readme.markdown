# praytracing

Python source code for [Peter Shirley's _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://github.com/petershirley/raytracinginoneweekend).
Heavily documented for better understanding (at least for me).

Part of this documentation is having type anotations, in the spirit of the
original C++ code, because I find that it helps bridge the understanding between
a programming and mathematical perspective. To this end, this needs **Python
3.6+** with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) installed (see `requirements.txt`).
